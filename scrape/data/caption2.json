The anterior <b>cerebral</b> artery (ACA) is a primitive rICA branch. Two large choroidal arteries are present: the anterior choroidal artery (AchoA), a branch of the rICA, and the posterior choroidal artery (PchoA), a branch of the cICA. Also shown are the precursors of the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Note that the anterior circulation supplies blood to the telencephalon (T), diencephalon (D), midbrain (M), pons (P), cerebellum (C), and medulla oblongata (MO).
